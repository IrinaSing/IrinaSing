## Hello to everyone! :wave: 
My name is **Irina.**  
I want to study web development and to find myself in a new profession :computer:  
Currently I participate in **HackYourFuture** project.  
My background: pedagogy, e-learning, design.  

I am ready to make mistakes :relaxed: Version control will remember them... :ok_hand: 

> A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.  

I am starting to like motivation quotes :thinking:
